This one's a 'lite' version of the other file.

What the hell does that mean? I have no idea!

It means that this one doesn't have the images folder and is a bit faster as it stores the images in memory rather than in your disk, and we all know disks are slow.

Use this if you plan on automating it, like say, running it every hour or so to try and find your patterns.

I'll include automation support for this version at some point in the future.
